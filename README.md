# home-assistant-batterX-api

## Important
They added their own HA config to their docs which works better than mine: https://batterx.gitbook.io/batterx-livex-api/other/home-assistant

### About this repo

This is the stuff I needed to put into the configuration.yaml of my Home-Assistant setup to be able to connect the API of my BatterX-System to it before there was an official config.
I decided to archive this repo Since it is still the first result on Google for "batterx home assistant" as I'm writing this.
